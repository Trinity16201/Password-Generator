My motivation for this was to challenge myself with javascript. I have never used some of the functionality in practice before and this helped me to gain a better understanding. I can see how this could be used in other areas for requests that a user would choose certain items to be used in their desired outcome. I do feel that I have a better understanding on variables, functions, and if statements. 

To create this page I worked with some of my classmates: Pamela Agrast, Zach Harvey, Joe Axe, and Maria Juan. I also utilized a tutor, BCS assistant, and a friend who already works in the field. Countless articles have been read in the process as well.
